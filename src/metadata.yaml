 This is cinder storage driver charm support to use freenas/truenas core/truenas scale integration for OpenStack Block Storage.
 Cinder is the block storage service for the Openstack project.
 .
  The driver code forked from https://github.com/iXsystems/cinder (only support freenas 11.3). 
  Driver was repackaged to https://github.com/databunnysg/databunnystoragedriver with further fix to support Truenas core/Truenas scale. 
  And published as pypi package databunnystoragedriver https://pypi.org/project/databunnystoragedriver/.
  Usage is simple:
  Step 1:
  Create or modify a driver config file, lets say: driverconfigfile.yaml
  Modify the config paramerter to exactly match your freenas/truenas configuration.
  Step 2:
  juju deploy cinder-databunny-driver
  juju add-relation cinder-databunny-driver:storage-backend cinder:storage-backend
  juju config cinder-databunny-driver --file=driverconfigfile.yaml
  Step 3:
  waiting for cinder-databunny-driver become active
  login to openstack dashboard, create volume type and Update Volume Type Metadata volume_backend_name databunnystorage
  
  Wait for cinder-databunny-driver juju status become active and now you can use openstack dashboard create volume with volume type databunnystore, those volume will be provision and managed by freenas/truenas
